	<h1>Rules</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>Consider yourself a part of fandom. Ask yourself, Am I in fandom? Yes? Awesome.</li>
		<li>This webring is 18+ due to the likelihood of NSFW content. Please be 18 or older when joining.</li>
		<li>You must have a personal website. This does not include social media accounts or free Carrd accounts. Check out the <a href="ideas.php">ideas & resources section</a> if you need help getting started. Your personal website does not have to be fandom-focused, however; the fandom aspect largely applies to the webmaster, not the website.</li>
		<li>This webring does not support the use of generative AI for fanworks or any other type of creative work.</li>
		<li>Fandom is as chaotic and controversial as any other community of people, and I personally do not believe it should feel policed or stifling. At the same time, I do believe in boundaries. The major boundary of this webring is that websites and works that <b>endorse, promote, or exemplify intentionally hateful messaging toward any marginalized group of people are <u>prohibited</u></b>. This includes but is not limited to (neo/)Nazis and TERFs.</li>
		<li>The webring must be visible and easy to find, such as on your index/splash page, in a sidebar/footer, or on a dedicated page for webrings, cliques, or other exits and affiliates.</li>
		<li>That's it! It's pretty simple &mdash; just be a fan, have a website, make the webring visible, and don't be a dick.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>How to Join</h1>

	<p>First, put this code somewhere at the top of the page where you would like the webring to appear, preferably before <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>:

		<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fandomr.ing/onionring/onionring.css"&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>Then use this code for where you would like the webring to show up:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;div id='fandomring'>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://fandomr.ing/onionring/onionring-variables.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://fandomr.ing/onionring/onionring-widget.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

	<p>It won't display properly yet, but that's because you still have to be added. You can do that by emailing me at <b>fandomring@pm.me</b> with the following:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<b>Subject:</b> Fandom Webring Application<br />
		<b>Body:</b><br />
		Your website's URL:<br />
		Your website's name: <br />
	</blockquote>

	<p><b>Your website's URL</b> is the link to your website.</p>

	<p><b>Your website's name</b> is how you would like your website to be titled/referred to in the directory.</p>

	<p>After you submit your application, within 48 hours you will receive an email notifying you if your website has been approved. If it has, the webring will now appear where you placed it.</p> 

<p>Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. You can email me if you need to change any of this information as well.</p>

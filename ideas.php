	<h1>Ideas & Resources</h1>

	<p>Not everyone in fandom has experience with creating or managing a website of their own. These days it feels more common to participate in fandom through the use of existing platforms: Tumblr, Twitter/Bluesky, LiveJournal/Dreamwidth, AO3 &mdash; through making accounts so that we can attribute a name to our works. But a website is beyond that. Instead of just creating an identity, we also create a space that is intrinsic on our identity.</p>

	<p>But even if the idea of having a website sounds appealing, you might ask yourself, what would I even put on it?</p>

	<p>So I've gathered here a non-exhaustive list of ideas in case you would like inspiration. No credit is required; these are merely examples of things that would be fun for me to find on a personal fannish website. Feel free to "steal" as many as you'd like or merely get inspired by them and do something different. All I'd ask is for you to do what brings you joy for what you want your website to be.</p>

	<h2>Ideas</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>List (in text or images) your fandoms, both past and present. Or maybe just present.</li>
		<li>List (in text or images) your ships. Perhaps divided by fandom.</li>
		<li>List (in text or images) your favorite characters, celebrities, content creators, biases. And maybe your more controversial opinions for spice.</li>
		<li>Recs for fic, art, meta, essays, and other types of fanwork.</li>
		<li>Rec other fan creators.</li>
		<li>Show off your toolkit for writing, reading, browsing the internet, music, PC, desktop setup</li>
		<li>Make a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now</a> page</li>
		<li>Write about your history in fandom</li>
		<li>Archive or list the fandom events you've participated in. Perhaps the works you've created or received from these events as well.</li>
		<li>Archive your fic. Though AO3 will certainly be stable for quite some time, there's also no harm in archiving your fic elsewhere as well.
			<ul><li>And then join the <a href="https://ficring.neocities.org">ficring</a>, a fanfiction site webring.</li>
				<li><a href="https://nianeyna.dev/ao3downloader">Here's a script to help you download your own fics from AO3.</a></li></ul>
		<li>Alternatively, create a masterlist of your fic. The masterlist can organize your fic or fandoms differently form AO3, perhaps in a way that is more suitable for your fic or fandoms.</li>
		<li>A gallery for fanart. I've compiled <a href="https://kingdra.net/links/artists.php">a list of resources specifically for artists</a> who are looking to make a personal site for their art. Check out <a href="https://omoulo.com/artists_vs_social_media">omoulo's "artists vs. social media"</a> as well.</li>
		<li>Other types of fanwork you may consider creating and/or sharing: 
			<ul><li>Drabbles, ficlets, and notfic</li>
				<li>Poetry</li>
				<li>Fan translations</li>
				<li>Podfic</li>
				<li>Music, filk</li>
				<li>Cookbooks/recipes</li>
				<li>Fanbindings</li>
				<li>Reviews, podcasts, audio/video essays, and commentary</li>
				<li>Glossaries, encyclopedias, and other meta resources</li>
				<li>Vids, edits, and fanvids</li>
				<li>Fan calendars</li>
				<li>Tarot cards</li>
				<li>Paper crafts</li>
				<li>Fancovers (like book sleeves/covers)</li>
				<li>Comics/doujinshi</li>
				<li>Graphics/icons</li>
				<li>Manips, banners, picspams</li>
				<li>Favorite gifs and memes</li>
				<li>Knitting, crochet, embroidery, quilting, stitching</li>
				<li>Cosplay photos</li>
				<li>Buttons/pins</li>
				<li>Games and interactive fiction</li>
				<li>Music covers</li>
				<li>Photography</li>
